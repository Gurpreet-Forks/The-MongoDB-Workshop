 //insertOne command can be called to insert one document at a time. Letâ€™s look at it in action:
 
 db.blogs.insertOne(
     { username: "Zakariya", noOfBlogs: 100, tags: ["science","fiction"]
 })
 
 
 
 //insertMany() command allows you to insert multiple documents in one go. You can pass an array of documents to the command as mentioned here:
 
 db.blogs.insertMany([
     { username: "Thaha", noOfBlogs: 200, tags: ["science","robotics"]},   
     { username: "Thayebbah", noOfBlogs: 500, tags: ["cooking","general knowledge"]},
     { username: "Thaherah", noOfBlogs: 50, tags: ["beauty","arts"]}
 ])
